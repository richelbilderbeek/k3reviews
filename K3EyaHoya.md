## Richel's review

This song does not have (non-moronic) lyrics, the melody suggests the song is about partying. 
Personally, I would only play this song at my funeral when I want the guests to leave.
While being alive, I immediatly remove this song from my playlist.

K3 should understand that their strength is in the lyrics!
