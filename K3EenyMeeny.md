## Richel's review

In this song, K3 sing about being in love with two men, and unable to
choose, they choose one at random. The song has two moods: neutral
verses and a cheerful chorus.

Personally, I dislike the lyrics for pursueing monogamy (as the girls
have to choose), instead of considering a more liberal relationship. I
think my favorite lyric should have been 'Ik love Gert, but I also love Sam(son)'.
