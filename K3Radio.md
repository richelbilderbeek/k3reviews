In this song, K3 describes a fun plan: because they are singing on the
radio that holiday will start today and last 6 months, you can celebrate
it with the excuse that you heard that news on the radio.

Personally, I like this song: the melody is cheerfull, the theme is
playfull and it is the fun logic construct that should be put into K3
songs more as brings the lyrics to a higher level.
